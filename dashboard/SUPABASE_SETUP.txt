SUPABASE SETUP - STEP BY STEP
================================

1. Create Account
   - Go to https://supabase.com
   - Sign up with GitHub or email
   - Create new project (choose free tier)
   - Wait for project to be ready

2. Create Tables
   - Go to "SQL Editor" in your Supabase dashboard
   - Copy and paste this SQL:

CREATE TABLE games (
    game_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    home_team TEXT,
    away_team TEXT,
    game_date TEXT,
    season INTEGER,
    week INTEGER,
    home_score INTEGER,
    away_score INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE odds (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    game_id TEXT,
    sportsbook TEXT,
    home_odds REAL,
    away_odds REAL,
    home_spread REAL,
    away_spread REAL,
    over_under REAL,
    timestamp TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE team_season_summary (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    team TEXT,
    season INTEGER,
    wins INTEGER,
    losses INTEGER,
    power_score REAL,
    point_diff REAL
);

3. Import Data
   - Go to "Table editor"
   - Click on "games" table
   - Click "Insert" > "Import data from CSV"
   - Upload games.csv from cloud_export folder
   - Repeat for odds and team_season_summary tables

   - Looks like: postgresql://postgres:password@db.xxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres

5. Update Your Code
   - Replace this line in your dashboard files:
   
   OLD: DB_PATH = "sqlite:///E:/Bettr Bot/betting-bot/data/betting.db"
